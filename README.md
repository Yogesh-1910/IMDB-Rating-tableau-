### Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a single, interactive dashboard that provides a multi-faceted view of the top 1000 movies on IMDb. The dashboard is designed to answer key questions about movie trends, including:
-   Which movies are most popular by vote count?
-   How has the number of movie releases and their gross earnings changed over time?
-   What are the most dominant genres?
-   How do IMDb ratings and critic Metascores compare across different genres?

### Key Visualizations and Features

The dashboard combines several worksheets to provide a complete analytical view:

-   **Horizontal Bar Charts:**
    -   Top 10 movies ranked by the total number of votes.
    -   Distribution of movie certificates (e.g., U, A, PG-13) by the total number of movies.

-   **Area Charts:**
    -   Visualizes the trend of total movies released each year.
    -   Shows the trend of total gross earnings generated by movies year over year.

-   **Word Cloud:**
    -   Highlights the most common movie genres, with the size of the text corresponding to the number of movies in that genre.

-   **Box Plots:**
    -   Compares the distribution of IMDb Ratings for the top 10 genres.
    -   Compares the distribution of Metascores for the top 10 genres.

-   **Interactive Text Sheets:**
    -   Displays detailed information for a selected movie, including its description, genre, release year, IMDb rating, Metascore, gross earnings, and starring actors.

### Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Top 1000 IMDb Movies dataset**. This rich dataset includes a variety of attributes for each movie:
-   **Identifiers:** `Series Title`, `Certificate`, `Genre`, `Director`, `Star Actors`
-   **Metrics:** `IMDb Rating`, `MetaScore`, `Number of Votes`, `Gross Earnings`
-   **Temporal Data:** `Release Year`, `Runtime`

This dataset provides a solid foundation for analyzing trends in movie popularity, critical acclaim, and financial performance over time.

### Creation Process (Methodology)

The dashboard was built in Tableau following a structured, step-by-step process:

1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:** The IMDb movie dataset was imported into Tableau.
2.  **Worksheet Creation:** Each visualization was built on a separate worksheet.
    -   **Bar Charts:** Created by dragging dimensions (`Series Title`, `Certificate`) to Rows and measures (`Number of Votes`, `Count of Series Title`) to Columns.
    -   **Area Charts:** Created using `Release Year` as a continuous dimension and measures like `Count of Release Year` and `Sum of Gross`.
    -   **Word Cloud:** Built using the `Genre` field for Text and `Count of Series Title` for Size.
    -   **Box Plots:** Generated by placing `IMDb Rating` and `Metascore` on the Rows shelf and `Genre` on the Columns shelf, with "Aggregate Measures" unchecked.
3.  **Formatting:** Each worksheet was carefully formatted by adjusting colors, adding labels, and hiding unnecessary headers to improve clarity.
4.  **Dashboard Assembly:** All the created worksheets were combined into a single dashboard view with a fixed size of `1850x1050` pixels.
5.  **Interactivity:** Actions and filters were configured to allow the worksheets to interact with each other. For example, clicking on a movie title in a chart can filter the Text Sheets to display the details for that specific movie.
